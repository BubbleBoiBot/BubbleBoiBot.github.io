			<h2>Before we begin, here are a few things you will need to know:</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Skribbl.io uses three seperate ports; Port 5001, Port 5002 and Port 5003.</li>
				<li>A join code is the part of the private game URL that comes after the ?. For example; the join code of "skribbl.io/?DKvrAPOEum" is DKvrAPOEum.</li>
				<li>If you need any help the launcher GUI, <a href="wiki-gui.html">click here.</a></li>

			<h2>How to join a private lobby:</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Firstly, you will need to specify the join code in the bot's GUI launcher. You can find this in Join settings. Paste the code there with no spaces.</li>
				<li>Secondly, you will need to find what port the private game is using. To do this, launch the bot once on each port using the GUI and using the join code you specified. 
					The two ports that join a random game are your incorrect ports. The port that joins your private game is the correct port.
				</li>
				<li>Finally, close all the ports, remembering which port is the correct port, and run the bot again with whatever settings you want on the correct port and using the correct join code. 
					You can skip this step if you only want one bot on the game.
				</li>
